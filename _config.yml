            I manage all the IT needs for the company. Deploying phones and laptops and managing our networks and servers. A large part of the job has been streamlining existing processes. I've digitized timesheets, workorders, billing, and many other things that were all being done on paper.

            It's been a huge challenge to get everyone onboard, but undertaking the task has been fun and rewarding.

            I ran a computer repair shop in the downtown area. I repaired Macs and PCs as well as doing onsite work for homes and businesses. Onsite I set up networks, servers and home theater systems. Running this business was a very rewarding endeavor, I was able to learn new things and enjoyed the problem-solving challenges I was greeted with every day.

            Medium was a bootcamp for learning development and design. I learned here that I work best with a challenge. I worked with clients, developers and designers to make sure that our clientsâ€™ needs were met and exceeded. Working in such a creative environment kept work fresh every day.

          After being unhappy with the wallets available on the market, I created a premium aluminum wallet. I spent years perfecting the design in wood and plastic, and now have them CNC machined out of a block of aluminum.

          Available shells for the NES were lacking in comfort. I fixed that. Modeled off of a popular modern console controller, you are free to play your old games with the comfort of modern controllers.

          Thanks to the hard work from some great friends, we were able to help over 74,000 service industry workers receive 124,000 generous tips during the pandemic. I started this project from a google spreadsheet and then managed an amazing team of developers and volunteers to help people that were suddenly out of jobs.
