          Implementing tech for a company that was using paper for just about everything.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            I manage all the IT needs for the company. Deploying phones and laptops and managing our networks and servers. A large part of the job has been streamlining existing processes. I've digitized timesheets, workorders, billing, and many other things that were all being done on paper.
            It's been a huge challenge to get everyone on board but undertaking the task has been fun and rewarding.

            I ran a computer repair shop in the downtown area. I repaired Macs and PCs as well as doing onsite work for homes and businesses. Onsite I set up networks, servers and home theater systems. Running this business was a very rewarding endeavor, I was able to learn new things and enjoyed the problem-solving challenges I was greeted with every day.
